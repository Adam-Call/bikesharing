## Summary

New York City is one of the most visited cities in the world by tourists. Meaning that the Citibikes are used by many people to navigate the city. This lends itself to the success of Citibikes however by looking at the number of Subscibers versus customers we see a large majority of the rides are by Subscriber members. This is a good sign for the Des Moines project as sustainibility is provided by these Subscribers by creating a base of loyal subscibers the has a route of being viable. 

Further analysis is recommended to look at the distance between the startiung location and ending location of each ride. This would allow for better idea of whether the city of Des Moines is sized in a way that will be optimal for bike rides. 

Another analysis would be to look at the number of repeat subscriber rides. The repeat subscibers would be crucial to the success of the Des Moines project.
